## Hotel Website

This is a project built by me to practice html and css.It is completely made using core css  features such as media queries,using relative sizing units and does not use newer features like css grids and flexbox.

## Project Structuring
### Html
The project's main folder contains the html files that will be served.
### Assets
The assets directory contains two subdirectories namely img and css for images and css file respectively
#### img
This directory contains the images used in this project.
#### css
This directory contains the css files.There are two main css files main.css and mobile.css .The file main.css defines all the css classes used in the project and the file mobile.css defines some of the class needed to make the project mobile friendly.
